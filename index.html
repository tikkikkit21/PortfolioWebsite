        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="./images/professional.jpg" width="255" height="255" alt="Tikki">
            <p>I'm a second-year at Virginia Tech, currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. I enjoy working with any kind of programming, but I especially love working in the backend. One of my most notable projects is a Discord bot I started back in December 2020. I had to self-teach myself JavaScript, MongoDB, and Linux in order to create and run it. The bot is currently doing well, being hosted in 1,000+ Discord servers and serving 2,500+ users. This summer, I'll be interning at the <a href="https://exelaration.com/" target="_blank">Exelaration Software Center</a>. After graduation, I plan to pursue a <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/Graduate/Degrees/MENG.html" target="_blank">Master's of Engineering</a> in Computer Science. I'll be focusing on Artificial Intelligence as I hope to work with autonomy in robotics and vehicles.</p>
